# Unboxed Technical Test

This repo contains a technical test for [Unboxed](https://unboxed.co/).

It's a small Sinatra app with two main functions:

- A "favourite language of a GitHub user" app at `/`
- A bit of frontend code showing a tweet from [@horse_js](https://twitter.com/horse_js) at `/horse`

## Running Locally

After cloning this repo and running `bundle install`, run `rackup` to boot the web application.
To run the tests, run `rspec`.
